## iScanMetricsWeb is two things:

First, it is beadChip.js, which is a critical component of the command line version of this application.
Second, it is ExpressJS wrapped around NodeJS


#### Designed to accomplish (implemented features):
  - Async file reading, parsing, and data population (see http://portalstack.blogspot.com for an article on it)
  - Provide a simple beadChip grid which opens a multi-tab sections grid for all/fail/pass sections using ExtJS 4.0
  - Use ExpressJS for featureful web server
  - Use Jade for modern templating

#### Capable of (not yet implemented):
  - watching metrics log folder for changes
  - populate new metrics when available
  - automatically update client information without refresh
